This is picycle.
It does basic data logging and statistics for bicycle speed using the Raspberry pi and a Reed switch.
The interpretation code is currently incomplete, and the data logging code has not yet been tested on a bike (my reed switch has not come yet).

It logs data in real time using revolutions, and this data can later be interpreted (by the same program) using wheel radius and desired units of measurement.
